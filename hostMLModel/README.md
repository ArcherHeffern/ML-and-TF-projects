This blazingly fast API will predict the temperature outside in celcius with at least a 98% accuracy (after inputting the temperature in fahrenheit). HOW is this possible?! Well its all thanks to my advanced machine learning model built with Tensorflow, which takes advantage of crazy math, all coming together to bring you this next generation temperature prediction tool.
